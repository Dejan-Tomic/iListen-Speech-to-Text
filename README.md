# About
A simple proof of concept audio to text transcribing app.

# Features
Hit record and the app will transcribe anything you say into text


# Compatibility
This project is written in Swift 5.0 and Xcode 11.4. It has been tested and works on an iPhone 11 running ios 13.4. It will work on other devices but the layout has not been optimized for them yet.
